# GANs for financial series generation
# Projects Admins:

#Aim of the progect:

The aim of the project is create a GAN capable of generating realistic financial time series. The folders of the projects have the functions:

- **data**: this folder contains all the dataset and the function to download new financial series and create dataset from them.
- **evaluate model**: this folder contains some functions that can be used to evaluate the series generated by the models, plotting some samples and the distribution of the series generated.
- **report**: this folder contains the pdf report that illustrates the aim of the progect and how the function used work.

# Download the data:

to donwload the data use the code contained in the data folder
